# McMultimedia
Multimedia plugin - access multiple types of multimedia in minecraft!

## Installation
Put the .jar file into the plugins/ directory of your minecraft server!

The rest of the installation is done by editing the config.yml file. It's pretty self explanatory. If you start the plugin unconfigured, it will crash.
